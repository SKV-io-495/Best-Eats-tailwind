# React JS Website Styled With Tailwind CSS

## Run npm install to install the necessary dependencies

 All of the data/images to simulate API responses are located at src/data/data.js

This was a fun little project of React & Tailwind, a super powerful front-end combination you can use to build websites quickly. In this build, I add a little extra javascript with the array filter method to filter out specific food types and pricing categories.
